# Hi, i'm Nuno Miguel Mvemba.

- I'm Nuno Miguel Mvemba, I started studying programming in 2017, with HTML, CSS, and javascript, depending on the time I was curious to learn about backend technologies, and I had the choice of Java language because it was the language I was learning at the university. In 2020 I met NodeJS in which I fell in love with its simplicity and the way it could be used for frontend and backend, and its philosophy, since then I dedicate my time to learning and improving my knowledge about NodeJS.
